MDM: The Future of Multimedia Storytelling in Markdown
MDM (Markdown+Media) is a superset of Markdown designed to seamlessly embed and control local multimedia content like images, videos, and audio with an intuitive syntax. It aims to solve the problem of broken media links and the lack of rich media control in standard Markdown, making it perfect for personal knowledge management (PKM), technical documentation, and digital content creation.

Note: This project is in the specification and initial development phase. The NPM/PyPI/Crates badges are placeholders for our future releases.

ü§î The Problem
Standard Markdown is great for text, but it falls short with local media:

Fragile Paths: Moving your .md files often breaks image links (../images/pic.png).

No Control: You can't specify a video's width, make it autoplay, or loop it without resorting to raw HTML.

Limited Media Types: Embedding audio files or creating image galleries is cumbersome and non-standard.

üí° The Solution: ![[]] Syntax
MDM introduces a single, powerful syntax: ![[]]. It's an intuitive extension of the familiar Markdown image syntax and the "wikilink" style used in tools like Obsidian.

üñºÔ∏è Images
Go beyond simple image display. Create centered, captioned, or stylized images.

Markdown

// Simple image embed
![[profile.jpg]]

// Image with attributes (alignment, width, alt text, caption)
![[brand-logo.png]{width=250px align=center alt="MDM Project Logo" caption="The official MDM logo"}]]
üé¨ Video & üîâ Audio
Embed and control video and audio files natively within your Markdown.

Markdown

// Video with controls, specified size, and no autoplay
![[product-demo.mp4]{width=720px controls=true autoplay=false}]]

// A looping, muted background video
![[background-loop.mp4]{loop=true muted=true}]]

// Embed an audio file with player controls
![[podcast-episode-1.mp3]{controls=true}]]
‚öôÔ∏è The .mdm Sidecar File: How It Works
To maintain 100% compatibility with standard Markdown, MDM uses an optional .mdm sidecar file. This approach separates media configuration from content, maximizing flexibility and portability.

1. File Naming Conventions
Default (1:1 Match): By default, an .md file is paired with an .mdm file of the exact same name located in the same directory. This is the primary and most intuitive method.

MyNote.md ‚Üî MyNote.mdm

Shared (N:1 Match): Multiple .md files can share a single .mdm configuration. To enable this, an .md file must explicitly declare the path to its source .mdm file in its YAML Front Matter.

YAML

---
title: "Chapter 1: Introduction"
# This document uses the project's shared media configuration.
mdm_source: "../_shared_media.mdm" 
---
2. media_root Path Resolution
Base Directory: When a relative path is specified for media_root, it is always resolved relative to the location of the .mdm file itself. This ensures that media links remain intact even if the entire project folder is moved or renamed.

Example: A media_root: "./assets" declaration points to an assets folder located in the same directory as the .mdm file.

üöÄ Technology Roadmap: Why & Milestones
MDM adopts a multi-language strategy to ensure both universal accessibility and high performance.

1. JavaScript (NPM) - The Web Ecosystem Hub
Why: To achieve maximum accessibility and ease of integration for web developers. This will be the reference implementation, perfect for static site generators, web-based editors (like VS Code extensions), and any frontend project.

Milestones:

v0.1.0 (Core Parsing Engine) - ETA 2025-Q4: Basic block/inline parsing of ![[]] syntax with image attributes ({width}, {align}).

v0.2.0 (Multimedia & Sidecar) - ETA 2026-Q1: Support for <video>/<audio> tags and parsing of media_root from .mdm sidecar files.

v0.5.0 (Stable Release) - ETA 2026-Q2: API stabilization, comprehensive bug fixes, and complete official documentation.

2. Python (PyPI) - The Data & Tooling Backbone
Why: To integrate MDM into the vast Python ecosystem, including data science (Jupyter), machine learning documentation, backend frameworks, and popular static site generators like MkDocs.

Milestones:

v0.1.0 (Initial Porting) - ETA 2026-Q2: A complete port of the JavaScript v0.2.0 feature set to Python.

v0.2.0 (Ecosystem Integration) - ETA 2026-Q3: Develop prototype plugins or extensions for key libraries like Jupyter and MkDocs.

3. Rust - The Performance Core
Why: To deliver blazing-fast performance for demanding applications like real-time editor rendering and large-scale document processing. Ultimately, this Rust core will be compiled to WASM (for web) and native modules (for Python/Node.js) to power all other implementations.

Milestones:

v0.1.0 (Core Logic in Rust) - ETA 2026-Q3: Implement the core parsing logic, validated by the JS/Python versions, in Rust.

v0.2.0 (WASM & FFI) - ETA 2026-Q4: Begin work on compiling the core to WASM to supercharge the JS parser and using FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to generate native Python modules.
